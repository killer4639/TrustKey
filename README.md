**Git commands to keep in mind-----**
Git commands for pushing and pulling changes to your branch

So next time when you start working just do this everytime before you start to work.

```
git checkout -b dev             (Remove -b after the first time)
git pull origin dev
npm install                     (make sure you do this in both root and client folder)
```

And then after you commit to your local branch dev do this

***Pulling from remote won't affect your local committed or uncommitted changes.***

```
git push -u origin dev
```
